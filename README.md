# verySimpleWebServer
A very simple webserver that can serve web pages

By default will look for files in the folder that it is in.
However, you can add an argument to tell the program what is the root folder of your project.

EG: node verySimpleWebServer.js ./projects/myProject/

Basically, press tab in command line and it will auto-complete correctly :)
